# Learn Python List Comprehension By Building a Case Converter Program

# List Comprehension is a way to construct a new Python list from an iterable
# types: lists, tuples, and strings. All without using a for loop or the `.append()`
# list method.

# In this project, you'll write a program that takes a string formatted in Camel
# Case or Pascal Case, then converts it into Snake Case.

# The project has two phases: first you'll use a for loop to implement the
# program. Then you'll learn how to use List Comprehension instead of a loop
# to achieve the same results.

    return "".join(snake_cased_char_list).strip("_")


def main():
    print(convert_to_snake_case("IAmAPascalCasedString"))
